## CA216 CPU Scheduling

This is the repo for the C starter files.  Read the details below carefully.  Note: the details of the different algorithms required for both the solo and pairs versions of the project are [found in the project spec](https://ca216.computing.dcu.ie/assessments/scheduling-assignment/) Only implement the files for the project-type you are undertaking.

Completing this project will require writing the following C files

schedule_fcfs.c
schedule_sjf.c
schedule_rr.c
schedule_priority.c
schedule_priority_rr.c

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter
```
make fcfs
```
which builds the fcfs executable file.
